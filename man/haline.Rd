\description{
The haline colormap is sequential, and might be used with dark blue representing lower salinity or fresher water, transitioning through greens to light yellow representing increased salinity or saltier water. This colormap is based on matplotlibâ€™s \dQuote{YlGnBu}, but was recreated from scratch using the \sQuote{viscm} tool.
