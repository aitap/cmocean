\arguments{
\item{n}{integer giving the number of colours (>= 1) to be produced;
currently it does not make sense to ask for more than 256}

\description{
The delta colormap is diverging from darker blues to just off-white through shades of yellow green and could be used to represent diverging velocity values around a critical value (usually zero). This colormap was inspired by Francesca Samselâ€™s similar colormap, but generated from scratch using the \sQuote{viscm} tool.
